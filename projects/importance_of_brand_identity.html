                Hey there,
                Ever wondered why certain businesses have no problem capturing attention while others fade into
                obscurity? The
                answer is quite simple (in most cases), namely the brand identity. Let’s explore why it’s more than
                a simple logo
                your nephew could create with those pesky logo generation sites
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Key factors</h2>
            <div class="list-image">
                <div class="list-image--list">
                    <ol class="project-text-normal">
                        <li class="list-item">
                            <span class="list-item-start">Visual Uniqueness:</span> A brand identity involves a unique
                            blend of
                            <strong class="highlight">colors, fonts, and graphics</strong>. This makes your brand more
                            recognizable and leaves a lasting impression in your customers' minds.
                            In a crowded marketplace, <strong class="highlight">visual distinctiveness</strong> helps
                            your brand stand out, creating a visual anchor that sets you apart from competitors.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-item">
                            <span class="list-item-start">Comprehensive:</span> That’s not all – beyond aesthetics, a
                            brand identity encapsulates what your company stands for, its mission, and even how it
                            interacts with customers. It's a <strong class="highlight">visual shorthand for your brand's
                                values and personality</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-item">
                            <span class="list-item-start">Consistency:</span> <strong class="highlight">Not having a
                            brand identity is messy</strong>, you might interact differently through various social
                            media channels, or use other typography and colors throughout the years. This makes your
                            company less memorable and decreases profits in the long run.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-item">
                            <span class="list-item-start">Trust and Credibility:</span> Additionally, a well-established
                            brand identity builds trust and credibility among consumers. When customers can easily
                            recognize and understand your brand, they are more likely to <strong class="highlight">trust your products or
                            services</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-item">
                            <span class="list-item-start">Adaptability</span>: Finally, a brand identity makes it easier
                            to make way for change. It allows your business to <strong class="highlight">evolve with market trends and changes</strong>,
                            while maintaining the same look and feel, ensuring your brand recognizability and trust
                            fostered over its lifespan.
